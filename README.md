**ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Random Forest**

A Machine Learning Project for Predicting Stock Prices

This project aims to predict stock prices using the Random Forest Regression algorithm. By leveraging historical stock data, the model learns patterns and trends to forecast future stock prices. Random Forest, being a robust ensemble method, ensures reliable and accurate predictions.

**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the high volatility and randomness in the stock market. This project uses Random Forest Regression to predict stock prices based on historical features such as open, close, high, low, and volume. The focus is on building a model that can provide insights for potential stock price movements.

**ðŸ›  Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset**

Source: Dataset Source:- Yahoo Finance
Description: The dataset contains historical stock data with features like:
Date: The trading date
Open: Opening price of the stock
Close: Closing price of the stock
High: Highest price during the day
Low: Lowest price during the day
Volume: Number of shares traded

**ðŸ“ˆ Process Workflow**

Data Loading & Exploration:

Load historical stock price data.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any.
Feature scaling and normalization.
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Model Training:

Train a Random Forest Regressor on the training data.
Tune hyperparameters (e.g., number of estimators, max depth) for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict stock prices on test data and visualize the results.
